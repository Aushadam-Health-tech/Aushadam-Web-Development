# Aushadam-Web-Development

Here we will deploy all the code required for developing our Web and Mobile Application.
There are a few things we are concentrationg to create keeoing in mind what to include in the prototype of Minimal Viable Product. 
Create three new branches excluding main branch as there are 3 pairs of Back-end and Front-end developers.
Once the code in the each branch is finalized and working, it will be merged to the main branch.
After designing and developing the common things like onboarding and profile setup of doctors and patients, we will develop the required portal for the prototype i.e, Gastroenterology dept.
